          <div id="top_beads"> <!-- beginning of beads area -->

		  <div id="bead_heading"> <h1>Beads</h1><h3>There are many different types of beads, in many shapes, sizes and colors. Here are some popular choices available around in the market now.</h3></div>
		  <div id="bead_1"><h2>Seed beads</h2>These tiny rounded beads are used for the majority of beadweaving and embroidery projects and can be used for multistrand jewelry. They come in various colors, finishes and sizes. The higher the size number, the smaller the bead, because the the size number refers to the number of beads that can fit along an inch.</div>
		  <div id="bead_2"><h2>Crystal beads</h2>Crystal beads are made from glass with a high lead content, which increases the sparkle when the facets are cut. This makes them more expensive but the quality is so much better.</div>
		  <div id="bead_3"><h2>Bugle beads</h2>Bugle beads are long, thin, tube-shape beads. They are also made of glass and come in many of the same finishes and colors as seed beads do. </div>
		  <div id="bead_4"><h2>Wood beads</h2>Wood beads are inexpensive and lightweight, even when very big, so they are suitable for chunky designs. Wooden beads often have bigger threading holes than other beads, so you can use a wider variety of stringing materials.</div>
		  <div id="bead_5"><h2>Pearls</h2>The real pearls are usually very expensive. For beading projects, we usually use the imitation pearls. They are made of glass beads with a pearlized coating, which are more affordable and are great for fashion.</div>
		  <div id="bead_6"><h2>Semi-precious stone beads</h2>Beads made from semi-precious stones can be very expensive but using them for accent or focal point can greatly improve your design. Some stones need special care so check with the seller before you buy them. </div>

          <div id="top_tools"> <!-- beginning of tools area -->
          <img src="assets/toolsimg.jpg" alt="Basic beading tools" class="img_div"/> 
          <div id="tool_heading"><h1>Tools</h1><h3>Jewelry tools are designed especially for jewelry making. They have smaller noses, making beading easier. Although there are all sorts of tools available, most would agree that the basic tools for beginners are round nose pliers, chain nose pliers, cutters and a crimping tool. As your interest expands, so will your collection of tools.</h3></div>
          <div id="tool_1"><h2>Round nose pliers</h2>Round nose pliers are used to make circular loops on head pins, eye pins or wire. The bottom section is used for large loops while the tips are used for smaller loops.</div>
          <div id="tool_2"><h2>Chain nose pliers</h2>The jaws of these pliers have a smooth gripping surface for holding tiny objects. They are essential for gripping wire, making right angles and to open and close jump rings and loops.</div>
          <div id="tool_3"><h2>Wire cutters</h2>These are used to cut beading wires. The shape of the blades gives you a clean and flush cut on the wire which will make your design look neat and professional.</div>
          <div id="tool_4"><h2>Crimping pliers</h2>The jaws of these pliers have two grooves which are designed to secure crimp beads or tubes onto beading wires. </div>

          <div id="top_strings"> <!-- beginning of strings area -->
          <img src="assets/stringsimg.jpg" alt="Assorted beading stringing materials" class="img_div"/> 
          <div id="string_heading"><h1>Stringing Materials</h1><h3>The choices for picking stringing materials can be overwhelming since they are varied from project to project. The way to approach this is to decide what design you would like to make first, and then go from there. Remember to have fun! Many unconventional materials may give your design a good surprising result. </h3></div>
          <div id="string_1"><h2>Flexible beading wire</h2>Flexible beading wire is made of various strands of fine stainless steel which are coated with a nylon coating. That is why they come in all sorts of fun colors that you can incorporate into your design. Usually, the weight and the design will determine the choice of wire.  </div>
          <div id="string_2"><h2>Memory wire</h2>Memory wire is tempered wire that remembers its shape and retains its coiled form. For those who want to make wine charms or napkin rings, it is important for the wire to keep its shape.</div>
          <div id="string_3"><h2>Stretch thread and cord</h2>These are made of plastic. They are flexible and are used for making designs that don't need clasps. To fasten these, tie a square knot with an extra wrap and finish it with a bit of jeweler's cement.</div>
          <div id="string_4"><h2>Suede and leather cord</h2>These also come in various colors. A very simple design for this kind of material is to hang a pendant or a single beautiful large bead from the cord or the suede. The cord ends are used to finish this kind of design.</div>
          <div id="string_5"><h2>Silk cord</h2>Silk cord must be used with a needle. They are traditionally used for stringing pearls and small gemstones with knots between the beads. Knotting between beads prevents the beads from rubbing against each other. Also, if the string breaks, you will not have a disaster. </div>

          <div id="top_findings">  <!-- beginning of finding area -->
          <img src="assets/findingsimg.jpg" alt="Assorted jewelry findings" class="img_div"/>
          <div id="finding_heading"><h1>Findings</h1><h3>Findings refer to the hardware used in the design. They are usually made of either base or precious metals.</h3></div>
          <div id="finding_1"><h2>Head pins</h2>A head pin looks like a long, blunt, thick sewing pin. It has a flat or decorative head on one end to keep beads on.</div>
          <div id="finding_2"><h2>Eye pins</h2>An eye pin looks like the head pin except it has a round loop on one end instead of a head.</div>
          <div id="finding_3"><h2>Jump rings</h2>A jump ring is used to connect two loops.</div>
          <div id="finding_4"><h2>Split rings</h2>Splits ring are used like jump rings but are more secure.</div>
          <div id="finding_5"><h2>Crimp beads</h2>Crimp beads are small, large-holed, thin-walled metal beads designed to be flattened or crimped into a tight roll.</div>
          <div id="finding_6"><h2>Clasps</h2>The most common clasp is the toggle, consisting of a ring and a bar. They are the easiest to fasten and the most secure. The lobster claw opens when you pull on a tiny lever. The S-hook links two soldered jump rings or split rings. The slide consists of one tube that slides inside the other.</div> 
          <div id="finding_7"><h2>Earring findings</h2>When making earrings, you can choose lever-back, hook or post-style for the findings.</div>
